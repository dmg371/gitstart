Xerox's commitment is to produce waste-free products in waste-free facilities to help our customers reduce waste. Our aim is to design products, packaging and supplies that make efficient use of resources, minimise waste, reuse material where feasible and recycle what can't be reused.<BR /><div class="xrx_tag_fb_featured_box featured_box_xog"><div class="xrx_tag_fb_corners"><b class="xrx_tag_fb_left xrx_tag_fb_tl">&nbsp;</b><b class="xrx_tag_fb_right xrx_tag_fb_tr">&nbsp;</b></div><div style="height:95px;" class="xrx_tag_fb_content"><STRONG>Featured Links:</STRONG><BR /><span class="xrx_tag_morelink"><a class="xrx_tag_morelink" name="&lid=cell3-recycle used xerox cartridges" href="http://www.xerox.co.uk/about-xerox/recycling/engb.html">Recycle used Xerox cartridges</a></span><BR /><span class="xrx_tag_morelink"><a class="xrx_tag_morelink" name="&lid=cell3-designing products for reuse" href="http://www.xerox.co.uk/corporate-citizenship/2014/sustainability/sustainable-products/engb.html" target="_blank">Designing products for reuse</a></span><BR /><span class="xrx_tag_morelink"><a class="xrx_tag_morelink" name="&lid=cell3-how green is your print shop?
